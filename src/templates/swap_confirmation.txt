We have a Swap!

The following is an official binding agreement between these two respective parties for a Profit Swap of:
 

{{ user1_name }}
Paying

{{ user1_percentage }}%

AND 

{{ user2_name }}
Paying

{{ user2_percentage }}%

In the following event:
{{ tournament_date }} - {{ tournament_name }}
Whereas both parties acknowledge and attest that the receipts uploaded below by them personally are for said event:

{{ user1_receipt_url }}

{{ user2_receipt_url }}

Whereas both parties are in agreement to pay the agreed percentage on any profit earned (winnings earned minus the amount of one (1) original entry into this event) to each other.

DON'T FORGET!!!!

Your Swap Rating is calculated by how quickly you pay out on your Swaps.  The quicker that you pay out on each Swap, the higher your Swap Rating will become.

GOOD LUCK!!!
USER UNDERSTANDS THAT SWAP PROFIT DOES NOT GUARANTEE PAYOUTS BETWEEN USERS. SWAP PROFIT IS ONLY FACILITATING SWAPS BY PROVIDING A COMMUNITY MARKETPLACE FOR USERS TO COMMUNICATE, AS WELL AS  WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN USERS ONCE A SWAP HAS TAKEN PLACE. SWAP PROFIT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ACTUAL PAYOUTS BETWEEN USERS ONCE A COMPETITION IS COMPLETED AND RESULTS PUBLISHED.  SWAP PROFIT WILL PROVIDE USERS PREFERRED PAYMENT METHODS TO THEIR SWAP PARTNERS AND COMPLETED PAYMENTS BETWEEN USERS WILL BE TRACKED, POSTED TO THEIR PROFILES AND CALCULATED INTO A USER’S SWAP RATING. AFTER A COMPLETED INVESTIGATION, ANY NONPAYMENT ON A CONFIRMED SWAP WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF A USERS ACCOUNT AND SWAP PROFIT WILL COOPERATE IN ANY LEGAL ACTION THE NON-PAID PARTY DECIDES TO PURSUE. SWAP PROFIT AT ITS DISCRETION MAY ALSO REPORT NON-PAYMENT OF SWAPS TO RESPECTIVE INDUSTRY MEDIA OUTLETS SO THAT OTHER PARTICIPANTS ARE AWARE– see our SWAP RATING POLICY.

The "Swap Profit Payout Model" is computed as follows:

Earnings (any amount earned by the User in the event in which the User has registered for)

Minus

One (1) original price of entry

Equals:

Profits that will be counted towards Swap Payouts.

If the event the User is competing in is a Re-Entry event, additional re-entries will NOT be credited and ALL OF THE USERS ORIGINAL SWAPS WILL STILL BE ACTIVE FOR THE DURATION OF THE EVENT.

User will still receive any applicable rewards for each tournament receipt that is uploaded.
